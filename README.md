Modal Metabase
===

Serverless metabase deployment on modal labs.



Notes
---

While _technically_ you can deploy metabase this way, I wouldn't currently recommend it.
Any time the container is cold-started, the application takes multiple minutes to boot-up.

You can deploy metabase on digital ocean or fly.io for ~$6/month with no cold-starts which is pretty hard to beat.
